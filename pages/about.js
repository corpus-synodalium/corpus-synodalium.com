        <p>
            Late medieval European society was profoundly shaped by the legal
            institutions and lawmaking activity of the Catholic church. From the
            late twelfth century onward, papal law proliferated, with the curia
            sending forth letters and decrees to the farthest reaches of
            Christendom. The resulting legislation, which accounted for much of
            the so-called “general law” of the church, covered a vast range of
            topics, from the election procedures for bishops to the proper
            attire of Jews, and from criminal procedure to the validity of
            testaments. Few areas of late medieval life were left untouched.

        <p>
            On a local level, this rapid expansion in papal lawmaking found its
            echo in the expanded legislative activity of bishops, which was
            usually carried out at the regular gatherings of provincial councils
            and diocesan synods. The resulting legislation survives from nearly
            every part of Latin Christendom and its thematic range easily rivals
            that of the general law. Given its richness and detail, it has few
            parallels as a window into the social and religious history of late
            medieval Europe. Notwithstanding the significance of this local
            legislation, however, it has long been eclipsed (in terms of
            scholarly interest) by the church’s general law. This comparative
            neglect of local ecclesiastical legislation has persisted even as
            medievalists working on other areas of church history and the
            history of religious life have long since broken free of the
            gravitational pull of the medieval papacy and its centralizing
            structures.

        <p>
            Comparative work on this local ecclesiastical legislation has been
            hampered by the scattered nature of these sources. Roughly 2300
            distinct texts survive for the period 1200-1500, and many of these
            remain in manuscript or are available only in rare early modern
            printed editions. Over the past few years, the project leader (Rowan
            Dorin) has worked to mitigate this challenge, initially through
            assembling the first-ever repertory of this corpus, and subsequently
            (with the help of a team of research assistants) through the
            creation of a full-text database of these sources.
        </p>

        <p>
            Where previous scholarship on local ecclesiastical legislation has
            necessarily operated within narrow geographical and chronological
            bounds, this full-text database will soon enable large-scale
            comparative analysis of this rich historical sourcebase. Scholars
            interested in medieval law and church history will be able to
            explore systematically the limits of normative centralization, the
            survival of local specificities, and the willingness of local
            authorities to embrace, resist, imitate, or innovate in the face of
            papal directives. And given the breadth of topics encompassed within
            this genre – from marriage to moneylending – the full-text corpus
            will hopefully become a point of reference for anyone pursuing
            research on the social and religious history of late medieval
            Europe.
